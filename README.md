# Portfolio-Webpage

### EPIC! Opening Statement:

This webpage will be my personal porfolio. The goal is to make one page that a potential employer can view to see all of my work. This is a work in progress and will be added or modified as my skills increase. 

For starters, my page will include the following:
1. A large introduction animation
2. A section showing my focus
3. A link to my projects (Possibly GitHub, CodePen)
  * What projects should I create to showcase?
4. A section of my skillsets
5. Links to my social media  
  * LinkedIn
  * Medium
  * Twitter
  * CodePen
  * GitHub
